# JOB-A-THON-JAN-2023

APPROACH FOR THE SOLUTION OF PREDICTING THE CLTV SCORE: - <br>
➢ Imported all the required libraries for the data <br>
➢ Loaded the data in the data frame <br>
➢ Checked the null values, the data doesn’t contain any null values. <br>
➢ Checked the value counts for all the variables <br>
➢ Replaced all the Categorical columns into Numerical columns.<br>
 ➢ Checked whether the data contains any duplicate value, the data doesn’t contain any duplicates. <br>
➢ Divided the data in training(60%) and testing set(40%). <br>
➢ Loaded the catboost model<br>
 ➢ Fitted the model <br>
➢ Predicted the model score using r2 as metrics. <br>
➢ Also checked both training and testing accuracy.<br>
 ➢ Performed hyper parameter tunning using grid search cv for better results.<br>
 ➢ Predicted with the hyper parametered model.<br>
 ➢ Cleaned the test data also.<br>
 ➢ Implified the model on test data. <br>
➢ Created the Csv file as mentioned<br>
